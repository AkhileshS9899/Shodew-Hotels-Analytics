Shadow Hotels â€“ Data Analytics Dashboard:
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
This project analyzes data from Shodwe Group, a large hospitality chain with properties across India. The chain was struggling with fragmented, Excel-based reporting, making it hard for management to track revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and booking trends in real time.

To solve this, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a centralized view of performance across hotels, room categories, and booking platforms. The solution enables management to shift from reactive decisions to data-driven, proactive strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
The group faced key challenges:
* Reports were manual and inconsistent, leading to unreliable KPIs.
* No real-time visibility into occupancy and revenue.
* Lack of a centralized view across properties, making comparisons difficult.
* Weekend vs. Weekday trends were not tracked, impacting pricing strategy.
* Limited insights into room category performance and cancellation patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Approach:
Data Preparation:
* Combined multiple datasets (fact_bookings, fact_aggregated_bookings, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, dim_date).
* Cleaned and transformed raw data for consistency.
  
Dashboard Development:
* Built KPIs for revenue, occupancy %, bookings, cancellations, and no-show %.
* Created property-wise and state-wise performance comparisons.
* Added insights into room class contributions and booking platform performance.
* Incorporated time-based analysis for weekday vs weekend trends.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
* Certain properties outperform others consistently, driving most of the revenue.
* Room categories vary in profitability, with premium rooms showing higher cancellations.
* Weekend occupancy is higher, but weekday underutilization impacts overall revenue.
* Some booking platforms contribute high revenue but also higher cancellation rates.
